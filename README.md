Make sure you clone both the locapost repo and the google-play-services_lib as we need it in order to run GoogleMapsApi in our localpost app. Since the path for the google-play-services might be off, go to the localpost project Properties->Android and in 'Library' add the right path
----Disregard code below
In order to run the app, you must setup the 'Google Play Services'. First download them using the 'Android SDK Manager'. Then go to File->Import->Android->existing Android ...->Next->Browse(Look up the 'Google Play Services' dowloand location. It should be where you installed ADT in sdk/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib)->Finish. The right-click on 'localpost'(our app) and Properites->Android->(In the 'Library' part)Add->google-play-services_lib->Apply. The app should be running afterwards. Let me know if anything is not clear. - Timotei
