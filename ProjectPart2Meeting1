	No TDD
	Have a person outside the group test our app. 
	Swap apps with a group and test eachothers app.
15:17:57
	Go through the User Stories in Project Problem Description and decide how we will implement them. Michael is recording this on the wiki page.
15:23:27
	Hashing with hamming distance to load data in advance (Advanced feature, we decided we will look at later). It will solve the problem of slow retrieval.
15:28:56
	Talk about test cases for comments location relative to user and relative to other comments.
??	Do we chose the location we want to be in? Is the location automatically retrieved so that we can only   have a discussion in our location?
15:35:21
	Top level comments.
15:39:44
??  How are we going to efficiently search through the comments? How are they going to be indexed and retrieved in a timely manner?
15:48:08
	Talk about different UI's. Decided to use a map view where we can click on a area, a pin shows up, and then a new view opens where we can see the comments.
15:58:26
	Talk about how to sort by pictures. Decided to sort comments by timestamp and then sort by the ones that have a picture.
16:06:36
	Alain tries to come up with a new name for 'karma' (scoring system -upvote/downvote). Result: huh/meh
??  Do we need to cache all the child comments or just the parent that is indicated?
16:12:35
??  Do we need to retrieve new replies to favorites locally as soon as it happens?
??  What does greatest means? (From the requirement: The user wants to see the latests greatest comments)
16:26:07
	Fresh, greatest and latest? Is it similar to reddits new, top, hot, controversial tabs?
16:38:13
	For author of comments, hash the MAC address of the user and use that to create unique ID regardless of whether multiple users chose the same name (i.e Anonymous (ID: ...) - 4chan model).
16:53:31
	Draw a rough outline of the UI with every view we will have. pictures were taken in order to design them later on the computer.
16:56:38
	For the map view, we click on a spot which is in turn returned to the app. In this way we can implement changing a comments location or changing the location as you are writing a new comment.
17:08:57
	Discuss the licence. Decided on MIT
	Draw the UML diagrom on the board. See picture
17:18:23
	Talk about the User Model class. Discussed how to generate the user ID, when and how to change it.
17:27:05
	Talk about the Post Model class. Decided to only use one model instead of a Parent or Child Model that would inherit from the Post Model class.
17:33:02

	Thread View (screen after the Splash Screen)
